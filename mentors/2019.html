						<p>As so-called "smart devices" become widespread in homes, farms, factories and cities, it is become increasingly important to be able to analyze and respond to information gathered by these devices quickly, often in close to real time, and with increasingly sophisticated machine learning techniques.  The available computing capacity near such devices&mdash;computational power, memory capacity and sometimes energy&mdash;are all extremely limited.  The major solution being explored today is to use specialized or "heterogeneous" hardware, such as a low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or a custom ML accelerator, which can provide 1-2 orders-of-magnitude better raw compute power and compute power per watt compared with general purpose CPUs.  The goals of our research are (1) to make it possible to run more computationally intensive workloads (e.g., machine learning and signal processing) than is possible today near the edge; and (2) to make it possible for application developers who may not be computing experts to be able to program these heterogeneous systems, which today are challenging even for computing experts to program.  We have developed a compiler system called Heterogeneous Parallel Virtual Machine (HPVM) that aims to support a wide range of high-level (general purpose and domain-specific) programming languages on a wide range of heterogeneous hardware accelerators. In these SPIN projects (positions available for 1-4 students), you will begin by using HPVM to compile a few neural network models written in the TensorFlow library, Keras, to work on a heterogeneous system that combines a Xilinx Zynq-7000 (ARM+FPGA) development board. You will then experiment with different techniques to optimize the generated FPGA designs, in collaboration with the team of graduate students working on the HPVM project.  During the course of the year, we will optionally also target a machine learning accelerator such as the Intel Movidius Myriad X VPU, for ML problems in computer vision.</p>
						<p>Preferred qualifications:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Experience with Python programming</li>
							<li>Experience with at least one machine learning framework, preferably but not necessarily TensorFlow or Keras</li>
							<li>Evidence of strong intellect</li>
							<li>Evidence of being diligent and persistent in past endeavors</li>
							<li>Experience working with large software systems would be a plus but not necessary</li>
							<li>Experience in systematic performance evaluation would be a plus but not necessary</li>

						<p>Thermoelectric materials can convert heat directly into electricity. The discovery of new semiconductors for thermoelectric applications is a challenging task, but it is also of extreme importance to contribute and accelerate the development of the next generation clean and renewable energy sources.</p>
						<p>There are many factors that can affect a thermoelectric material's properties. For instance, by introducing impurities in the crystalline structure of some thermoelectric materials, we may be able to highly improve their performance by tuning their electronic properties.</p>
						<p>We are then interested in using high-throughput first-principles calculations to investigate how defects can help us achieve high-efficiency energy conversion in materials with potential thermoelectric applications.</p>
						<p>Depending on the student's interest and experience, the work can either be focused on the development of computational tools for data management and analysis or on the understanding of fundamental physics and chemistry of the materials.  Interested students are expected to have some experience or be willing to learn density functional theory. Basic programming skills will be very useful.</p>

						<p>Newly emerging neuromorphic chip architectures from IBM and Intel enable a novel class of algorithms that describe behaviors commonly associated with the neural cells than the fixed logic of computers.  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are at the core of these chips; they differ drastically from other current approaches to AI, such as those based on deep neural networks (DDNs) that require an extensive offline training. The objective of this project is to explore Loihi&mdash;a SNN research chip from Intel&mdash;in order to understand and characterize its potential for novel algorithms and applications for simulating nature-inspired processes. We are particularly interested in how to integrate real-time learning and adaptation that is an essential feature of all living organisms.</p>
						<p>The student will first study theory of SNNs and explore simulation software, such as GENESIS, to model SNNs consisting of a small number of neurons. He/she will then study Intel's Loihi's architecture and its programming model supported by Intel's NxSDK via a remote access to Intel's Neuromorphic Research Cloud (NRC) system and will implement small SSNs on this chip and compare results from the simulation software and the chip.  Eventually, the student should be able to setup and demonstrate to the research team how SNNs can be implemented and trained on Loihi and describe their potential and limitations with regards to the neural systems that can be efficiently modeled on this architecture. This project is particularly suited for students interested in continuing with advanced degree at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science.</p>

						<p>Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitously found at the centers of most galaxies. Measuring SMBH mass is important for fundamental science such as understanding the origin and evolution of SMBHs and enabling the usage of quasars&mdash;SMBHs that are actively growing by accreting gas from their surroundings and emitting light time series&mdash;as "Standard Candles" for cosmology. However, traditional methods require spectral data which are highly expensive to gather; the existing ~1,000,000 masses represent ~20 years' worth of state-of-the-art community efforts. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project&mdash;in which NCSA is a major partner&mdash;will discover ~1,000,000,000 new SMBHs across most of the observable universe; it would take ~20,000 years to weigh them with traditional methods. Therefore, a much more efficient approach is needed to maximize LSST science, which is, however, still lacking.</p>
						<p>To solve this problem, here we propose a pilot SPIN research project to develop a completely new, interdisciplinary approach. We will combine astronomy Big Data with machine learning tools to build an algorithm that weighs SMBHs using quasar light time series, circumventing the need for expensive spectra. There are empirical evidence and theoretical reasons to believe that the mass information is encoded in the light time series. However, the encoding is highly nonlinear, which is difficult to fully model using human engineered statistics. We will train deep learning algorithms that directly learn from the data to map out the nonlinear encoding. The result would transform the field of SMBHs and cosmology.</p>

						<p>Machine learning (ML) has made transformative impacts on modeling many high-dimensional complex dynamical systems. Multiphase flow is one of the promising targets for using ML to improve both the fidelity and efficiency of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. We are examining the use of ML to fit the CFD simulation data to develop closure relations for multiphase flow system. For example, DNNs can be trained on datasets with flows where the initial velocity and void fraction are different. The trained model is then used to predict other flow evolutions with different initial conditions. More broadly, we are tackling problems encountered with the interplay between learning and multiphase flow such as: How can learning algorithms be constructed to include physical constraints such as the incompressibility of fluid? What dimensionality reduction techniques and coarsening strategies are most applicable to identify hidden low-dimensional features? How can the computational scientists, experimentalists and theorists collaborate to produce sufficient training database for multiphase flow simulation?</p>
						<p>The student will use open source software packages such as TensorFlow and PyTorch to construct networks to improve predictive capabilities based on a high-fidelity DNS simulation database. The student will have access to HPC platform at NCSA and learn to analyze CFD data at large scale. Besides of the practice of typical ML skills, the student will also learn more fundamentally on how the neural networks be designed to best incorporate physical constraints while avoiding overfitting to imposed physics, as typical statistical learning methods can ignore underlying physical principles.</p>

						<p>African American women have a 4-5 fold greater risk of death from breast cancer compared to Caucasian women, even after controlling for stage at diagnosis, treatment, and other known prognostic factors.  Our initial cross-sectional studies suggest that the composition of serum from African American vs. Caucasian women were different and reflected biochemical changes due to socioeconomic status. Thus, we are now tackling a complex multidimensional dataset including proteomic, genomic, biometric, geographic and socioeconomic measurements. These dimensions need to be harmonized and correct statistical approaches applied, in order to determine the exact combination of factors that drive this racial health disparity. Additionally, we are planning to increase the size of our dataset, which will make the problem computationally challenging. We are also extending our analyses to other health disparity problems and other datasets. We invite a talented student to participate in this important and exciting project, and get involved in optimization of our analyses pipelines,  development of advanced statistical approaches and data analytics.</p>

						<p>Many research domains, such as computer vision and language understanding, have been transformed using novel machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods and techniques.  However, these methods are very compute-intensive and rely on state-of-the-art hardware and large datasets to achieve an acceptable level of performance.  Research team at the <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/about/org/isl">Innovative Systems Lab</a> (ISL) at NCSA has been investigating how neural networks at the core of DL algorithms can be implemented on reconfigurable hardware with the objective to speedup the execution and reduce power requirements for inference algorithms.  FPGAs are a good choice for implementing neural networks since they enable highly customized parallel hardware implementation and provide a great degree of flexibility with regards to numerical data types. Most recently, ISL started to explore a novel platform enabled by IBM's CAPI 2.0 interface and SNAP API.  This platform allows to develop FPGA applications using high-level synthesis (HLS) methodology rather than a traditional hardware design approach and integrate kernels accelerated on an FPGA with the host-side applications running on IBM POWER9 servers.</p>
						<p>The students working on this project will acquire the skillsets that are required to develop ML/DL algorithms in hardware using HLS approach. The students will be involved with a) evaluating performance of existing ML/DL implementations on reconfigurable hardware platforms and documenting the results, b) developing new ML/DL algorithms for implementation on reconfigurable hardware and preparing datasets for testing and evaluation, and c) helping ISL research staff with porting the algorithms to reconfigurable hardware.  Required skills include completion of ECE 385 and ECE 408 or equivalent courses.</p>

We will implement new features, such as the display and interaction with time-dependent data, as well as novel modes of interaction with the data. In addition, we will use and develop physics-based ray-tracing and stereoscopic rendering techniques to visualize the atomic and electronic structure of existing and novel materials e.g. for solar-energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.

Experiment and theory provide insight into size, shape, composition, and internal structure of different nanocrystals. Students in this team will work with computational and experimental researchers in several departments in order to establish a database to store, share, and catalog optical properties and other relevant data describing semiconductor nanocrystals. This requires developing schemas and analysis workflows that can be efficiently shared between multiple researchers. Students will first identify all information that will need to be included in this catalogue. Students will then write JSON and python code and interface with Globus and the Materials Data Facility. They will create well-documented iPython notebooks that operate directly on the Globus file structure and run in the web browser. Students will also develop code that automatically analyzes data stored in the facility, e.g. to verify and validate experimental and computational results against each other. Eventually, both the data and the workflows will be made available to the general public.

						<p>Arctic and Polar scientists have been studying the changes of specific landscape features, fauna, and flora over fairly restricted spatial extents using field expeditions and very high-resolution remote sensing datasets. Over the past years, combined efforts in polar geospatial science and HPC have yielded novel high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM), namely the ArcticDEM and the Reference Elevation of Antarctica (REMA). These state-of-the-art archives capture polar landscape surface at unprecedented spatial (meters scale) and temporal scales (2-3 weeks), and represent records of all the changes that happened and are happening at the Earth's poles. However, the size of the archives represents a real challenge for scientists to extract conclusive results. We are developing DL models that can be applied at a scale to conduct an inventory of polar landscape features and quantify their lateral and vertical changes.</p>

						<p>The students working on this project will acquire the skillsets that are required to develop DL models while applying them to monitor the current state of polar environments. The students will be involved with a) preparing model training sets from existing field survey data; b) evaluating the performance of different DL architectures that are suited to segment images, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, as well as architectures that are suited for detecting changes in image sequences, such as Recurrent and Siamese Neural Networks; and c) developing HPC workflows to manage and apply the developed DL models to existing elevation data archives leveraging the cyberinfrastructure at NCSA.</p>

						<p>Modern financial markets generate vast quantities of data.  As the data environment has become increasingly "big" and analyses increasingly computerized, the information that different market participants extract and use has grown more varied and diverse.  At one extreme, high-frequency traders (HFTs) implement ultra-minimalist algorithms optimized for speed. At the other extreme, some industry practitioners apply sophisticated machine-learning techniques that take minutes, hours, or days to run. The proposed project seeks to understand this full spectrum of machine-based trading, with the purpose to inform the public policy and to augment theoretical studies on financial markets. The research agenda focuses on three main themes. 1) Taxonomy.  Developing methodologies for estimating the amount of trading activity due to traders at each horizon from proprietary as well as publicly available data; 2) Machine-Machine Interaction. How do interactions among "cyber-traders" impact markets? Under what conditions do such interactions produce extreme disruptions like the Flash Crash of 2010? 3) Machine-Human Interaction.  Does machine-based trading mitigate effects of human behavioral biases?  Exacerbate them? Do the algorithms themselves introduce any novel types of biases?  How do microstructure effects impact larger-scale outcomes for asset pricing and corporate finance?  The proposed project will also organize six workshops on big-data research in finance, supported by NBER and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), to stimulate collaboration between financial economists and experts on high-performance computing (HPC) and big data. We are looking for a student with great English writing skills. It will be a plus if a succesful candidate also knows Chinese and has programing skills, but both skills are not necessary.</p>
