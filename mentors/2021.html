						<p>NEAT (NExt-generation sequencing Analysis Toolkit) is a software toolkit written in Python, primarily focused on generating simulated big data similar to next-generation sequencing machines. NCSA Genomics has recently taken over development of the NEAT software package, and updated it to Python 3, and now we are ready to take NEAT to the next level. NEAT includes advanced simulations of statistical properties of genetic data, visualization tools to help visualize and troubleshoot the parameters, and analysis tools to analyze real data to help shape the simulations. We are the process of adding advanced features such as wrapper scripts for bacterial population genomics and polyploid organisms. We have opportunities to learn Python, data visualization, production software workflows, and more! We are looking for interns to design, write and run unit tests, update documentation, and even develop some of the NEAT code using Python packages such as Biopython, Matplotlib, and Pandas.</p>

						<p>The Community Data Clinic and Cunningham Township are seeking a student with programming and web design skills for a project rebuilding the Illinois PATH 211 database from scratch. The new version will be a web-based directory based on a relational database of social service providers in the Champaign County area. The student's main task will be building out this web application to filter results and integrate user feedback. We are collaborating with local partners and stakeholders to ensure that our platform is as accessible and intuitive as possible, so a keen UI sensibility or experience with frontend accessibility would be a plus.</p>

						<p>For the first year we are imagining a lightweight proof-of-concept, perhaps just using JavaScript and Firebase, plus HTML and CSS. Future architectures might be designed to work from the PATH servers, but that's a long-term goal for now.</p>

						<p>Interested applicants should provide links to examples of relevant past projects and briefly explain their interest in community-based work.</p>

						<p>This project proposes the creation of an algorithm/library/tool that can be used to detect, analyze, and extract non-textual objects on page images scanned from print sources in the HathiTrust Digital Library and elsewhere. Pages in printed materials (books, journal articles, etc.) often contain important non-textual elements such as tables, figures, maps, musical notation, etc., sometimes with associated captions. When these are scanned and processed using Optical Character Recognition (for text-mining and other computational purposes), these non-textual features and their rich content are most often lost, greatly impoverishing the value of the original. This project will develop methods, algorithms, and tools to detect, extract, and describe these non-textual objects for further use and research.</p>

						<p><a href="https://datavault.dev.ncsa.illinois.edu/">DataVault</a> is an experimental data storage facility to house gravitational waves computed using the Einstein Toolkit. It was developed at NCSA to hold the eccentric waveform catalog of the NCSA gravity group. Scientists can upload waveforms as HDF5 files and search for individual waveforms using a content aware search engine using either a web form or REST API using the underlying "Girder" framework.</p>

						<p>DataVault uses a Python backend running inside of a set of Docker containers in a virtual machine hosted at NCSA's Nebula cluster.  Frontend functionality is provided using javascript and the pug templating engine.</p>

						<p>This project aims to improve the functionality of DataVault to offer a more convenient frontend search interface, and to port it to the newest Girder version, to transition to Python 3. We will also finalize containerization of DataVault including its ancillary NGINX and MongoDB servers. Time permitting the project will explore minting DOIs for the uploaded waveforms.</p>

						<p>The successful applicant will be collaborating with Roland Haas, the <a href="http://gravity.ncsa.illinois.edu/">NCSA Gravity Group</a> and the physics group of <a href="https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/hwitek">Helvi Witek</a>.</p>

						<p>Skill required: solid understanding of Linux, good grasp of Python, ideally with experience in web design, solid understanding of JavaScript for the frontend part. An ability to learn new frameworks and work with an existing code base is required as well.</p>

						<p>This project is part of the ongoing effort in the <a href="https://gravity.ncsa.illinois.edu/">NCSA Gravity Group</a> to study gravitational waves produced by colliding compact objects like black holes and neutron stars. We use machine learning techniques to improve LIGO's detection capabilities to be able to detect gravitational waves more quickly (lower latency) and increase the set of waveforms that can be detected (for example detecting black holes on elliptic orbits as well as circular orbits).</p>
						
						<p>Training these networks requires large numbers of training waveforms to be available to the network. We currently use LIGO's LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL) to produce these waveforms offline then read them in during the network training phase. For large parameter spaces this become infeasible since the training dataset increases in size to hundreds of terabytes. This project aims to produce training waveforms on the fly, interleaving a training epoch (on the GPU) with waveform production for the next epoch (on the CPU). You will use Python, LAL and TensorFlow to set up a pipeline that uses CPU cores to produce waveforms while using the produced waveforms to train neural networks. Students working on this project will have access to the HAL cluster at UIUC and Summit at Oak Ridge National Lab.</p>

								More than a gut feeling: A bioinformatics approach to studying the impact of diet on the gut microbiome and metabolic health

						<p><em>Background:</em> The phrase "a gut feeling" is clich&eacute;, but it may be truer than previously thought. The human gastrointestinal tract (or "gut") contains one of the most densely populated microbial communities on earth, comprised of trillions of microbes spanning at least 1,000 different species collectively known as the "gut microbiome." Interestingly, the gut microbiome and diet are independently linked to diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. However, there is little research on the impact of foods and nutrients and their impact on the gut microbiome, and subsequently, disease.</p>
 
						<p><em>Our work:</em> With the advent of advanced sequencing technologies and informatics techniques, we aim to fill this gap.  We have collected bacterial samples from participants that consumed specific foods, walnuts, almonds, oats, barley, avocado, and broccoli, during five different clinical trials. Sequencing the DNA of these samples yielded big data on the bacterial composition of each subjects' gut before and after the trial. Our goal is to utilize these sizable datasets to find connections between the foods and changes in the gut microbiome, along with various health markers, like blood sugar and body weight.</p>
 
						<p><em>Current progress:</em> Thus far, we have built a machine learning model that can predict which of the six foods mentioned above a person consumed with 86% accuracy. We are working to improve our model's accuracy, both via advanced data science techniques as well as incorporating additional data taken from the clinical trials.</p>
 
						<p><em>How you can contribute:</em> This project offers opportunities to work with large clinical datasets and machine learning techniques along with industry-standard bioinformatics software to analyze and visualize data. Knowledge of basic data mining, analysis, and visualization techniques is preferred. Familiarity with using command line tools is also a plus.</p>

						<p>Image-based pathology (histopathology) is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis but has been unable to differentiate high-risk cancer cases from low-risk ones. In the United States, this inability demands interventions for all patients and generates significant medical side effects, at an estimated annual cost of $4 billion for breast cancer alone. Since early 2000s, it has been recognized that high-risk cancer cases, but not the low-risk ones, are accompanied by an active tumor microenvironment for tumor cells to invade and metastasize. Thus, standard histopathology that focuses on detection of tumor cells but lacks information on the tumor microenvironment should ideally be complemented by an optical imaging technology that better reveals the tumor microenvironment. Using information extracted from the tumor microenvironment will permit to overcome this critical inability to differentiate low risk from high-risk. To better take into account the tumor micro-environment, here, we propose to use the multiphoton histopathology. Our hypothesis is that a combined standard and multiphoton histopathology, together with a demonstrated platform of a survival convolutional neural network, will dramatically improve the prediction accuracy for breast cancer outcome.</p>

						<p>The <a href="https://www.lsst.org/" target="_blank">Legacy Survey of Space and Time</a> (LSST) at Vera C. Rubin Observatory will obtain TB of data/night, producing a high-definition "movie" of the night sky. Correctly detecting, identifying, and segmenting astronomical sources efficiently is a top priority. LSST images will be so deep and detailed, that sources will be crowded or "blended" together. Looking to the rapidly-developing field of computer vision, our group has developed a proof-of-principle deep learning framework to process images and identify blended sources in them. However, the work and most others in the literature have thus far been limited to simulated images, untested on a real and large image dataset. To solve this problem, here we propose a SPIN research project to apply our novel image segmentation method to real images taken by the most powerful camera in the world, the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC), on one of the largest ground-based telescopes, the 8.5 meter Subaru telescope. Being the closest match to LSST in terms of the expected cutting-edge image data quality, HSC is the ideal dataset for evaluating and developing this interdisciplinary approach on real astronomical images. The SPIN student will develop and test deep learning architectures within our already proven framework. The student will leverage NCSA resources, such as the HAL GPU cluster, as well as collaborate with local experts. This is an opportunity to test and develop a competitive new approach combining astronomy big data with machine learning and computer vision.</p>

						<p>Declarative problem solving involves writing constraints as logic rules. For example, the following two logic rules solve the problem of checking whether a graph can be colored with only two colors: The first rule assigns either red or blue to a node X, while the second rule filters out failed candidate solutions, i.e., having two neighboring nodes X and Y with the same color:</p>

						<p><code>color(X,red) v color(X,blue) ← node(X).    % Generate ..</code></p>

						<p><code>false ← edge(X,Y), color(X,C), color(Y,C).  % .. and test</code></p>

						<p>For example the utility graph K<sub>3,3</sub> can be colored in this way (houses are red, utilities blue or vice versa), while K<sub>5</sub> (cf. Kuratowski's theorem) cannot. Graphs that can be two-colored are also called bipartite. A well-known example of bipartite graphs are Petri nets which consist of places and transitions and are used to model and analyze concurrency in distributed systems. In social network analysis, affiliation networks and folksonomies can be modeled as bipartite and tripartite graphs, respectively. </p>

						<p>The goal of the project is to visualize and analyze declarative solutions obtained from constraint-based specifications similar to the example above (this includes scheduling problems, optimizations problems, etc.)</p>

						<p><strong>Visualizing Declarative Solutions</strong><br />
						In this project you will apply information visualization techniques to display (i) problem instances, (ii) candidate solutions, (iii) failed candidates, and (iv) successful solutions in graph form. The goal is to come up with simple and intuitive renderings for a number of declarative problems and solutions.</p>

						<p>A successful candidate will help the STEM Illinois Nobel project to create a community health worker curriculum for middle and high school students. STEM Illinois is deeply rooted in the historic mission of land-grant institutions, which is to democratize higher education and to address the world's most pressing societal challenges. However, over 150 years after the Morrill Act was passed, social inequality reflects the harsh lived experiences of racially marginalized groups. These inequalities are especially visible in the field of computer science where, despite decades of pipeline programming, the number of underrepresented students remains alarmingly low. The goal of the STEM Illinois project is, to create a unique ecosystem that will nurture future computer scientists in industry and the academy. We believe that these students will follow Illinois tradition and address pressing societal challenges as innovators and Nobel Prize winners. </p>

						<p>We seek to increase the number of marginalized students majoring in computer science and medicine. The student will employ thier skills as a pre-med student to help us consider the topics to cover and the areas for innovations as we train community health workers. Innovation in training is especially relevant during COVID-19. At the beginning of the pandemic, the governor of New York deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to create a temporary hospital to address anticipated high levels of morbidity and mortality. We argue that another critical step in addressing the pandemic is to create a corps of community health workers to document the impact of COVID-19 and to share their resiliency tools in real time. These young community health workers will create new knowledge and engage in competitions to improve health and wellness using innovative motives. The student will serve as a mentor to Nobel participants.</p>
 
						<p>The intellectual contributions of this project is the documentation of the overwhelming cost of COVID-19 on the social, emotional, physical and financial health of U.S. citizens. The most important research contribution will be the volumes of data that we collect on marginalized groups' resiliency strategies during a pandemic.</p>

						<p>Fertilizer use remains below recommended rates in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, contributing to low agricultural productivity, pervasive poverty, and food insecurity. Small farmers have voiced suspicion that fertilizer is often adulterated, and evidence suggests that these suspicions lead to inefficient fertilizer use: too much in some cases, and too little in others. A key problem is that the quality of fertilizer is unobservable to the uninformed eye at the point of purchase.</p>

						<p>We have developed and are currently field-testing a machine-learning based, automated, rapid-response fertilizer quality verification service that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa can use to accurately assess the nutrient content of fertilizer at the point of purchase. A user can analyze a photograph of mineral fertilizer in the app and receives immediate evaluation of whether the fertilizer is adulterated. </p>

						<p>We are looking for a student to work with us on improving our existing classification model and to help improve the app as we receive feedback from Tanzanian users.</p>

						<p>Students with research experiences in machine learning and/or database management will be strongly preferred. Students should also have experience in Android app develop.</p>

						<p>This project is a subset of a NASA Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP) project aimed at creating several science-ready data products to help astronomers' search the literature in new ways. This goal is being accomplished by extending the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), known as an invaluable literature resource, into a series of data resources. One part of this process will be classifying the figures that appear in journal articles by their "type" (for astronomical literature, classes will include things like "images of the sky," "graphs," "simulations," etc). For this summer research project, a student will help with this image classification both by by hand and testing with machine learning methods in collaboration with Dr. Jill Naiman and/or a grad student (School of Information Sciences and NCSA).  The main parts of the project will involve developing the codebook of image classifications so that citizen scientists can complete more classifications on a large scale and running the by hand classification scripts. Options to extend this by working on the UI for the classification scripts (in Python, and/or for the Zooniverse citizen science platform) and working with the machine learning methods for image classification are available for interested students.</p>

						<p>Required skills: patience (ok with classifying images by hand), attention to detail (to develop the codebook for different and tricky image classes) and curiosity about the machine learning image classification process.</p>

						<p>Nice to have skills: experience with Python and machine learning (but these can be taught on the job)</p>

Determining underlying processes and mechanisms from this data, visualizing it in a comprehensive way, and using it to teach a broad general public as well as undergraduate students constitutes an important challenge. Over the last years, our team of SPIN students has used cutting-edge VR headsets and the LookingGlass holographic display to visualize electron-density data sets using isosurfaces and volume plots. Interaction with the data was implemented using the LeapMotion device or the VR controllers. It is now our goal to form an interdisciplinary team to develop immersive teaching experiences using these platforms. For this, existing Unity code will need to be extended to potentially include time-dependent visualizations and narration. Experience with Unity and Blender and teaching skills will be very helpful plus for this project.</p>

This adventure game will hopefully incorporate motion data capture, storage, and recall in order to build a community of participants in the game, as well as allow humanities scholars to access the data outside of the game. He is looking for creative minds who are interested in game design and production. This project needs an undergraduate who could help with basic programming in Unity 3D and/or Unreal Engine. Knowledge of C++ is a plus; alternatively, someone who can create 3D graphic elements would be very useful to this research project. If you have other skills that would be applicable to the project he would love to hear about them in your application.</p>

						<p>The Data Exploration Lab (DXL) is seeking a student interested in interactive 3D data visualization. The student will work with members of the DXL team to further develop new interactive visualization tools within the open source yt-platform. The main development pathways include a number of enhacements to the yt_idv package, a new python package based on imgui-opengl for interactive 3D visualation of yt, and a yt plugin for the napari visualization package. Specific goals for the yt_idv enhancements include UI transfer function control, UI vertex/fragment shader control and depth-buffer accumulation for blending visualization objects. The work requires a strong foundation in python including familiarity with packages in the scipy stack as well as proficiency in using Git and working in Linux environments. Familiarity with visualization methods and C, C++ or GLSL language are a plus, but not required. In addition to gaining hands on experience with 3D rendering methods and opengl graphics processing, the student will work on scientific communication skills through occasional blog articles submitted to the yt-blog. The student will participate in regular meetings with supervising DXL team members as well as weekly group meetings with the wider DXL team.</p>

						<p>Modern financial markets generate vast quantities of data. As the data environment has become increasingly "big" and analyses increasingly computerized, the information that different market participants extract and use has grown more varied and diverse.  At one extreme, high-frequency traders (HFTs) implement ultra-minimalist algorithms optimized for speed. At the other extreme, some industry practitioners apply sophisticated machine-learning techniques that take minutes, hours, or days to run. The proposed project seeks to understand this full spectrum of machine-based trading, with the purpose to inform the public policy and to augment theoretical studies on financial markets. The research agenda focuses on three main themes. 1) Taxonomy.  Developing methodologies for estimating the amount of trading activity due to traders at each horizon from proprietary as well as publicly available data; 2) Machine-Machine Interaction. How do interactions among "cyber-traders" impact markets? Under what conditions do such interactions produce extreme disruptions like the Flash Crash of 2010? 3) Machine-Human Interaction.  Does machine-based trading mitigate effects of human behavioral biases?  Exacerbate them? Do the algorithms themselves introduce any novel types of biases?  How do microstructure effects impact larger-scale outcomes for asset pricing and corporate finance?  The proposed project will also organize six workshops on big-data research in finance, supported by NBER and the <a href="https://xsede.org/">Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment</a> (XSEDE), to stimulate collaboration between financial economists and experts on high-performance computing (HPC) and big data. </p>

						<p>We looking for a student with excellent English writing skills. It will be a plus if they have programming skills, but it is not necessary.</p>
